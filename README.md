# Weather forecast application

## Description

As first-year students (frontend developer) at Nackademin, we were tasked with creating a weather forecast application. This was done using the **free open-source weather API from Open-Meteo.**

The application was built "mobile first" but works on other devices as well (like desktops, tablets etc.). Included features are min- and max temperature, time for sunrise/sunset, precipitation, wind speed/direction, weekly forecast and hourly update of weather on searched location. The weather is also presented as moving images.

Check out the final product here:
